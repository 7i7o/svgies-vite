                            <strong>SVGies</strong> are a unique visual representation of your wallet address <br />
                            You can mint <strong>only ONE</strong> per address because they are a 1:1 representation of your wallet <br />
                            {/* They are stored on-chain in the Polygon mainnet network <br /> */}
                            They are stored <strong>on-chain</strong> in the <strong>Ethereum mainnet</strong> network as a <strong>Soulbound NFT</strong><br />
                            You can think of them as Blockies that evolved to <strong>SVG</strong>s (Scalable Vector Graphics never get pixelated) <br />
                            Drawn as generative art in a beautifully detailed and colorful SVG <br />
                            Using Quadratic and Cubic BÃ©zier curves and leveraging our brain&apos;s ability to remember vertical simmetry <br />
                            It is tied to your wallet and <strong>cannot be transferred</strong>
