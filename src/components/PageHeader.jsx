                            SVGies are a unique visual representation of your wallet address <br />
                            You can only mint ONE because they are a 1:1 representation of your wallet <br />
                            {/* They are stored on-chain in the Polygon mainnet network <br /> */}
                            They are stored on-chain in the Ethereum mainnet network as a Soulbound NFT<br />
                            You can think of them as Blockies that evolved to SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics never get pixelated) <br />
                            Drawn as generative art in a beautifully detailed and colorful SVG <br />
                            Using Quadratic and Cubic BÃ©zier curves and leveraging our brain&apos;s ability to remember vertical simmetry <br />
                            It is tied to your wallet and cannot be transferred
