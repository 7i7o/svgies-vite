# SVGies
## A generative art unique wallet identifier

A new way to identify your ethereum wallet, with beautifully crafted bezier curves that never pixelate (due to being SVGs).

Inspired by *Blockies*, **SVGies** was born as a simple and easy, graphical way to distiguishing one address from another.
